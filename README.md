# MP-Mini-Delta

The two Ender3 images are screenshots of the sliced block in Cura v4.8 using the Ender 3 profile.

The two Mini images are screenshots of the same block sliced using the MP Mini Delta profile that was included in v4.8.

You can see in the Mini images that part of the brim is missing and there are strange gaps in the model.

I would like to learn how to clean this up so I can print this as cleanly on the Mini as I can on the Ender.  Any help would be apprecaited.
